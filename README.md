Subtitle: Understanding the Basics and Collaborating Effectively

What is a Pull Request?
### A pull request in GitHub is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows you to submit your modifications to the repository owner for review and eventual merging into the main codebase.

### How to Create a Pull Request:
- Fork the Repository: Create a personal copy of the original repository.
- Clone the Repository: Download the repository to your local machine.
- Create a New Branch: Isolate your changes in a separate branch.
- Make Changes: Implement your desired modifications or additions.
- Commit Changes: Save your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
- Push Changes: Upload your local branch to your forked repository.
- Open a Pull Request: Submit your changes for review and discussion.

### Collaboration and Review:
- Reviewers: Select individuals to review your code and provide feedback.
- Address Feedback: Make necessary changes based on the reviewers' suggestions.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Automated checks can be performed on your code.
- Discussions: Engage in discussions with reviewers and other contributors.
- Iteration: Continue making changes and pushing commits until the review is complete.

### Merging the Pull Request:
- Approval: Once reviewers are satisfied, they can approve the pull request.
- Squash and Merge: Combine all commits into a single coherent commit.
- Rebase and Merge: Incorporate changes from the main branch into your branch.
- Merge: Combine the changes into the main codebase.
- Delete Branch: Remove the branch after merging to maintain a clean repository.

## Title: Microsoft Office vs. Office 365
### Subtitle: Choosing the Right Productivity Suite for Your Needs

### Microsoft Office:
Microsoft Office refers to the traditional suite of desktop applications, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. It is typically a one-time purchase with a perpetual license, meaning you pay once for a specific version and can use it indefinitely.

### Office 365 (now Microsoft 365):
Office 365, now known as Microsoft 365, is a cloud-based subscription service that offers access to the latest versions of Microsoft Office applications, along with additional features and services. It provides online storage, collaboration tools, and regular updates to keep the software  up-to-date.

## Key Differences:
- Payment Model: Office requires a one-time purchase, while Office 365 is subscription-based.
- Updates: Office receives occasional updates, while Office 365 offers regular updates.
- Cloud Services: Office 365 provides cloud storage and collaboration features.
- Licensing: Office is limited to a specific version, while Office 365 grants access to the latest versions.
- Flexibility: Office 365 allows access to applications and files from various devices.
